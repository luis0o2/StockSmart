# Visualization Project for My Side Business Data

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share a project I've been working on that helps me visualize data for my side business. I sell various products in different countries and needed a way to track sales, returns, and profits. Here's a breakdown of what I've done:

## Project Highlights:

### Line Graph of Yearly Sales:

I created a line graph that displays the number of products sold throughout the year. This helps me see trends and peak sales periods.
Tabular Data:

I included a table that shows detailed information on the types of products sold, the quantity of each type, the profits made, and the number of returns. This allows me to keep track of inventory and financial performance.
Bar Graph of Sales by Country:

I developed a bar graph that shows the total number of products sold in each country. This visualization helps me understand my market distribution and where my products are most popular.
Here's a quick summary of the project:

### Line Graph: Tracks sales over the year.
Table: Shows product types, quantities, profits, and returns.
Bar Graph: Displays total sales by country.
Technical Details:

I used C++ and raylib for this project. raylib was particularly useful for creating the visualizations. The data is stored in a CSV file that contains columns such as Date, Product Type, Quantity Sold, Profit, Country, and Returns.
